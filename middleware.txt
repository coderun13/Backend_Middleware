Request -----> Middleware ------> Response

IN EXPRESS
Middleware in Express are functions that come into play after the erver receives the request and before the reponse is sent to the client.

Common middleware funxtions:
methodOverride
bodyParser
express.static
express.urlencoded

What Middlewares can do?
Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.

Using next
The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named 'next'.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle,it must call next() to pass control to the next line middleware functions.
